# Wind Lidar Data Samples

This repository provides links to wind lidar data samples with known provenance.

These data are provided for use by the community. Ideas for using them include:

- testing data import routines
- testing data conversion routines

.. and many other applications.

Note that certain data have digital object identifiers (DOIs), meaning that they can be uniquely identified.

### This list is:
- a place to find one or two well-documented examples of data

### This place is _not_:
- a place to find lots of wind lidar data from different wind lidar deployments. Please check [```Other data sources```](#Other-data-sources).

### Add a data sample to this list

If you would like to add a data sample, please [email Andy Clifton](mailto:andy.clifton@enviconnect.de).

Data samples can be linked to from here, and can also be stored in this repository.

### Criteria for inclusion in this list

Data samples are included on this list if:

- They are stored in a long-term repository, e.g., Zenodo, GitHub, A2e, or similar. Repositories that provide persistent digital identifiers (e.g., DOIs) are preferred.
- They are in a well-defined format, e.g., the manufacturer's own data format
- They are _either_ direct from the wind lidar _or_ direct from an output / conversion routine 
- They are of known provenance, i.e., it is clear what has happened to them. This can be demonstrated through the addition of metadata.

## Other data sources

- The Wind Resource Assessment Group ([wrag@groups.io](https://groups.io/g/wrag)) maintains a large list of wind lidar data in their wiki. However, the history of these data are not always clear. See https://groups.io/g/wrag/wiki/13236 for the list.
